## Loading and cleaning the data :: A reflection
  The Windows Store data was loaded in using read_csv() with configured columns to reflect the datatypes of each variable. The Price column stood out here, with an automated data type selection of a char (because of the "Free" entry in a lot of prices) and was then configured to be a double. With this change, we developed NA values for the prices of free applications, which then were changed to 0.0. As well as changing the Price variable configuration, I also parsed the Date variable and added columns for year and month for some future analysis dealing with distributions over certain days/years.


## Clean the data with our script
```{r}
source("CleanData.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
```
